These instructions allow to quantitatively assess stress in corals by measuring oxygen production (photosynthesis) of its algal symbionts. 

### Equipment & Materials:

Respirometry stand- a table with 8 metabolic cells (L49cm X W31cm X H32cm)

Big tank/cooler that can contain the metabolic cells table

Aquarium to raise all coral fragments

6 Volt, 2.8 Amp rechargeable battery + Battery charger + British socket adaptor

Water cooler and a heater that can be set and monitored

Lighting panel with variable intensities

8 magnetic stir bars (35-40mm)

Magnetic stir bar retriever (stick)

2 consoles of FireSting-O2 (pyroscience)

8 oxygen sensors (pyroscience)

2 temperature sensors (Pt100) (pyroscience)

Air pump

2 water pumps (to circulate the water in the tank)

Laptop with the Pyroscience workbench installed

Syringe

HOBO

Quantum (PAR) meter (µmol photons/m-2/s-1)

Aluminum foil / black plastic – big enough to cover all the cells 

1L glass beaker

50ml glass flask with narrow opening

Salinity meter

Coral health chart

Camera (can be a phone camera)

Sea water

DDW

4-5 fragments from five different colonies on plugs

0% oxygen calibration capsules

Plasteline

Parafilm
