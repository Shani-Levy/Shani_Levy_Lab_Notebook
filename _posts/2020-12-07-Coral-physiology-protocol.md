These instructions allow to quantitatively assess coral physiological parameters, i.e. tissue biomass (protein concentration), algal density and chlorophyll concentration.

### Procedure

1.	Remove the tissue from a frozen sample using an air brush within a 50ml falcon tube (if the sample was stored at -80°C the tissue will easily come off just by blasting air with the airbrush), then add 2ml of PBS/FSW to the tissue. If working with coral planulae or spats, add only 1ml of PBS/FSW.

2.	Dry the skeleton and save it for surface area measure (aluminum foil method).

3.	Homogenize the tissue with an electrical homogenizer.

4.	Remove 1ml of the tissue to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, keep the rest in the falcon tube as spare. If working with coral planulae or spats, remove 0.5 ml of the tissue to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.   

5.	Centrifuge the 1.5 tube for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.

6.	Remove 100ul from the supernatant to a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube for host protein measure. For protein concentration measurements I used the [Micro BCA Protein Assay kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23235?SID=srch-srp-23235#/23235?SID=srch-srp-23235) following the manufacturer’s protocol. 

7.	Remove the supernatant (host tissue) work with pellet (algae).

8.	Resuspend the algae with 1ml FSW/PBS and homogenize. 

9.	Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.

10.	Remove the supernatant. If working with few amounts of coral planulae/spats (<10 per tube), go directly to step n° 14.

11.	Resuspend the algae with 1ml FSW/PBS and homogenize. 

12.	Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.

13.	Remove the supernatant thoroughly 

14.	Resuspend the algae with 1ml FSW/PBS and homogenize.

15.	Take 30ul for algae count, using an hemocytometer. See the [protocol](https://fscucchia.github.io/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/Symbiont-cells-count/) for counting symbiont cells with Fiji (ImageJ).

16.	Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.

17.	Remove the supernatant thoroughly. 

18.	Add 1ml 95% Acetone. 

19.	Vortex.

20.	Incubate at 4-8°C (in the dark) for 8 - 24 hours.

21.	Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 5000rpm at 4°C.

22.	Check Optical Density (at wave lengths 630, 647, 664, and 697 nm) in a 96-well plate using 95% Acetone as blank (triplicates of 200 ul per each sample). I calculated chlorophyll a concentrations according to the equation of [Ritchie (2008)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11099-008-0019-7): 
Chl–a= –0.3319(A630) – 1.7485(A647) + 11.9442(A664) – 1.4306(A691)
